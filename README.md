# Haptics Extended
This project is inspired by [PatStrap](https://github.com/danielfvm/Patstrap), but does not share any code.
This project currently relies on [OpenIris](https://github.com/EyeTrackVR/OpenIris).

## Building
This should work for both Windows and Linux. But Linux is untested. 
```
pnpm install
pnpm tauri build
```
The builded .exe should be in `.\HapticsExtended\src-tauri\target\release`
